# Using the low-pressure gas manifold

[Work in progress]

Add a picture or diagram of the low-pressure gas manifold which is true to its layout in real life. Highlight all the relevant valves.

Add steps for using the getter here. At each step, include a diagram highlighting which valves should be open and which should be closed, with arrows showing the path of gas flow.

Information about ordering gas bottles - links to relevant CNSI pages.

Do not include maintenance information about replacing or installing Swagelok piping here, that should be reserved for the Swagelok page.
