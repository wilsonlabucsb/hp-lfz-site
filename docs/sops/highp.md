# Using the high-pressure manifold

Diagram of high-pressure manifold, true to its layout in real life. Perhaps a clearly labeled and highlighted picture. 

Description of the difference between the ball valves and the needle valves.

Include information about how to use the compressor, including how to turn on the compressed air, how to adjust the air drive regulator to control the compressor rate, the procedure for gradually increasing the air drive regulator pressure when trying to reach high pressure (in order to keep the compressor from stroking too fast), how to set the pressure limiter on the compressor by turning it, the difference between the gauges on the inlet and outlet lines (i.e., outlet might read zero and the other might not, which indicates a dangerous state because the outlet lines are plugged).

Do not include any information about the MaxPro cone and thread seals, save it for the MaxPro page.
