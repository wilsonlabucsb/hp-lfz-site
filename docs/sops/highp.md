# Using the high-pressure manifold

Diagram of high-pressure manifold, true to its layout in real life. Perhaps a clearly labeled and highlighted picture. 

Description of the difference between the ball valves and the needle valves.

The compressor is controlled by a compressed air supply, connected to the building air supply. The regulator between the house air connection and the compressor is meant to regulate the drive air which controls the rate of the compressor strokes. **It is important to make sure that the regulator setting is appropriate for the current pressure of the chamber.** This means that, when beginning to pressurize using the compressor (near 1,000 psi), the air regulator should be mostly unscrewed -- just tight enough to make the compressor stroke slowly.

!!! warning
    If the compressor is run at "full speed" (i.e., the air regulator is always set to a high drive pressure), then the high pressure O-rings within the compressor will quickly become damaged and the compressor will cease to work. It is therefore recommended that the air regulator pressure be **slowly increased** while pressurizing the chamber. Higher gas pressures will demand higher air regulator pressures. Try to keep a moderate pace of the compressor strokes during pressurization by keeping manual control over the air regulator pressure to extend the O-ring lifetime.

There is also a pressure limit switch attached the compressor, it is a hex nut with small holes in the side of the hex (need picture here!). Tightening this nut will increase the maximum pressure of the compressor -- be cautious not to increase this beyond the maximum pressure of the components downstream.

!!! warning
    The gauges on the inlet and outlet lines are not to be treated as identical. The most dangerous situation is where the outlet might read zero and the inlet does not, which indicates a dangerous state because the outlet lines are plugged. Therefore, the chamber should NOT be opened and the remaining pressure should be vented by slightly opening a high-pressure connection close to the chamber.
