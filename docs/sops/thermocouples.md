# Using the thermocouples

[Work in progress]

Numbered list of steps to place the thermocouples into their ports, turn on the thermocouple box, open the software, change the settings to choose the right COM port, and click connect (which can be hidden if the window isn't expanded).

Also, a note about how hot the chamber is allowed to get. Too hot and the O-rings of the chamber windows will melt and extrude.

!!! warning
    The temperature readings can be systematically off due to electromagnetic interference from the translator cables, particularly at room temperature.
