# Using the pyrometer

## Section I: Using the pyrometer software
1. The software "DataTemp MultiDrop" is used to view the video feed and get pyrometry (temperature) readings. To open DataTemp MultiDrop, click on the following icon (pinned to the Taskbar).

2. Open an "Application Configuration", which stores the settings previously used by DataTemp MultiDrop. These include the window layout, plot formatting, and pyrometery methods (e.g., 1-color vs. 2-color modes).
