# Beginning a growth

[Work in progress]

Add information about what to expect upon starting a growth.

This includes options for where to position the rods (i.e., melt feed? melt seed? melt a flux pellet?), how fast to generally ramp the power, to expect a dip in the pyrometer temperature when melting, considerations about ablating your sample, how to join the feed and seed, etc.
