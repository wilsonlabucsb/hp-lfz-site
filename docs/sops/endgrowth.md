# Ending a growth

[Work in progress]

This page should contain information about what to do when ending a growth. This includes:

- How fast to power down the lasers (can either slowly cool down the melt or just turn them completely off if the sample is no longer in the beam). Maybe mention that the lasers can damage the walls of the chamber at high enough power.
- A note about letting the chamber cool down after a growth. If it's still hot when you depressurize, more volatility will fly out the outlet. Also, if it's still hot when you open the seals, volatility will tend to float out the top of the chamber.
