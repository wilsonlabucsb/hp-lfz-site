# About the LabVIEW code for the Laser Controller Software

Steven: I sketched out a breakdown of what parts of the original LAPIS LabVIEW code do what, and [placed them in a PDF here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eIm3INYOvn-jOO_6wLd4AplpV0w4F9jZ/view?usp=drive_link).
Since then, the code has been modified to suit the IPG lasers (rather than the Coherent lasers), but the general action flow is the same.

The source code for the LabVIEW software can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wilsonlabucsb/hp-lfz-laser-controller/).

There is a local Git repository on LOKII PC 2, in the folder "Laser Controller Project - GitHub". Changes here can be pushed to the remote repository that lives on GitHub.
