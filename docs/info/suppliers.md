# Suppliers for various consumables

For more permanent parts, see the [LAPIS Parts List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17jvw7dukA4UU4l6dHvRP12d6tl1QzgLI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113393530670482605273&rtpof=true&sd=true) on the Google Drive. 

## Shroud
- Cylindrical windows are 22x24 fused quartz tubing from Technical Glass Products ([link](https://technicalglass.com/product/fused-quartz-tubing-22x24/))
- Ask TGP if they can cut the tubing into 15 mm (+/- 0.5 mm) tall cylinders, otherwise you will have to ask someone in the chemistry glass shop to cut it, and they really don't enjoy cutting glass for us.

## Sample mounts / shaft pieces
- Order the feed and seed holders from SciDre. They are relatively expensive.
- Alumina washers are from McMaster and can be found on the parts list, I believe ([link](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/washers/?s=ceramic+washers))
- Collars are also from McMaster and can be found on the parts list. Set screws for the collars are part 94355A228 on McMaster.
- Set screws for the sample mounts (feed and seed holders) can also be found on McMaster, size M3. In the past we've ordered sizes 92605A512 (4 mm) and 92605A514 (6 mm) on McMaster.

## Destec Seal Rings
- Destec requires pro-forma payment, which means that they need to be paid before they ship the items.
- Email Jason.Jeal@destec.co.uk and ask for a quote. karen.simpson@destec.co.uk might also be able to help, but it seems like they are more focused on the shipping side of things rather than sales. Order a good amount (maybe 60) at a time, because there is a long lead time and they likely don't enjoy walking us through the purchasing process because we are a small client to them. The part is "Size 8 Seal Ring Inconel 718 MoS2 Coating 20*M24654"
- Paying them has historically been an administrative challenge. Last time we paid them, we sent them a Purchase Order  (or perhaps a "wire payment" according to Chris Gloo / Lynne Leininger from CNSI Purchasing) for the seal rings and then separately generated a shipping label ourselves and forwarded them the label so they can ship it to us. It is easiest for us to arrange the shipping label (through FedEx).
