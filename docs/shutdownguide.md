# Shutdown guide
**Purpose**: A reference to be used *each and every time* by experienced users of the furnace.

## Section I: Power down the furnace
1. Turn off emission on all lasers, and verify that the output power reads "OFF" in the Laser Controller Software.

1. Turn off the translation and rotation.

1. Stop the screen recorder.

1. Stop the pyrometer Data Recorder.

1. Allow chamber to cool to a reasonable temperature.

## Section II: Depressurize the chamber
1. Once the chamber is cool, open the chamber outlet ball valve, followed by slowly opening the chamber outlet needle valve to allow a small flow, until the chamber pressure is a few psi lower than the pressure of the inlet piping.

1. Open the inlet ball valve, then slowly open the inlet needle valve to allow gas to vent from the inlet piping into the chamber.

1. Continue opening the outlet needle valve to vent the remainder of the pressure inside the chamber.

## Section III: Remove sample and clean furnace

1. ***Verify that BOTH gauges read zero***, and leave the outlet valves open.

1. Remove the top set of clamps.

1. Gently slide the top translator housing upwards and remove the remains of the feed rod, as well as the washers and collars. Consider vacuuming any loose powder.

1. Translate the upper shaft downwards, until it is near (but not at) the translation limit.

1. Clean the length of the upper shaft, then translate it upward into the translator housing.

1. Vacuum any loose powder in the translator.

1. Using a Kimwipe, IPA/EtOH, and some small tweezers, clean the inside of the top translator.

1. Remove the top shroud piece and seal ring.

1. Remove bottom set of clamps.

1. Gently slide the bottom translator housing downwards.

1. Carefully remove the shroud window.

1. Translate the seed rod upwards until the set screw on the bottom of the seed rod holder is visible above the shroud. Carefully remove the crystal and the seed rod mount from the shaft. The crystal may be weakly attached to the seed rod, so it may be wise to grab the crystal first before removing the seed rod mount.

1. Remove the lower part of the shroud and the seal ring.

1. Consider vacuuming or collecting any loose powder.

1. Remove washer, collar, and shroud cup. Careful, as these may be full with powder after a volatile growth.

1. Vacuum any loose powder in the translator.

1. Translate the bottom shaft upwards until it is near (but not at) the translation limit.

1. Clean the length of the bottom shaft, and then translate it downwards into the bottom translator housing.

1. Using a Kimwipe, IPA/EtOH, and some small tweezers, clean the inside of the translator.

1. Using a ball of Kimwipes, IPA/EtOH, and the long tweezers (forceps), clean the inside of the chamber.

1. Clean the interior and exterior off the shroud pieces and shroud window.

1. Place all small hardware in a beaker with some IPA/EtOH, and use the sonicator to clean these.

1. Retract both the top and bottom translator shafts, and slide both translators towards the chamber before leaving.
