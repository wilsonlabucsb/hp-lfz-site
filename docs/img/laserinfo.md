## Section VII: Laser components
Each fiber laser consists of a control unit, a fiber optic cable, and collimating optics. Each laser emits a wavelength of 1070 nm and is capable of reaching 200 W of highly collimated infrared light. This totals a whopping 1400 W of laser power, and just a few milliwatts can start a fire. The light is invisible, and thus can be incredibly dangerous. It is important to prioritize laser safety when working with these furnaces.

***Some quick do's and don'ts:***
!!! danger
	- Do not bend the fiber optic cable, it is very fragile and has a minimum curvature that it can withstand.
	- Do not allow any dust or dirt to obstruct the output of the laser optics. These particles can burn or melt the optics themselves.

## Laser safety
There are several key components of laser safety in the Laser Lab.

- Firstly, the optics should always keep the beam in an enclosed space, such that minimal free laser light is able to leave the lens tubes and/or chamber.

- Secondly, the laser curtains should always be (***closed***) when the lasers are armed to emit any infrared light. This is evidenced by the green "Start" button being illuminated on the front housing of each laser unit. This does not necessarily mean they *are* emitting any infrared light - emission is indicated by the large orange LED bar on the front of each laser unit.

- Similarly, whenever the laser units are armed, occupants of the lab should be wearing laser safety goggles with optical density (OD) 6+ at 1070 nm. These are not strictly required when the laser curtains are closed but should certainly be worn at all times when the curtain is open and the lasers are armed (regardless of whether emission is on).


### Using the Laser Unit Touchscreens

The touchscreen on the front of the laser units should be used sparingly, only for basic or absolutely necessary tasks such as turning on the aiming beam, enabling/disabling pulsing ("Gate Mode"), and for urgent needs to turn off emission / emergency shutoff.
