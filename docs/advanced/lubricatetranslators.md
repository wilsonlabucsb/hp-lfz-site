# Lubricating the translators

To lubricate the translation shaft
---
Lubricate the length of the translator shaft with MoS$_2$ - grab a small vial and pour in a small amount of MoS$_2$ powder. Add some IPA or EtOH to create a suspension and sonicate to mix.

No other lubricants should be allowed into the chamber or pressure tubes - they can be combustible when in contact with high-pressure oxygen.

To lubricate the keyed shaft and lead screw
---
Use the Shell lubricant in the cabinet and apply a small amount to the length of the keyed shaft and lead screw. Translate the shaft all the way up and down using the touchscreen to spread it into the magnet pack.
