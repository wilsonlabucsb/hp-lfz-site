[Work in progress]

The translators can be opened from either end, each quite difficult to open. Opening from each end has its advantages in certain situations.

Removing the inconel adapter:

- The adapter can be removed using a 15/16" wrench and a 14 mm hex attachment to the square drive on the torque wrench. The four large hex drive bolts that hold the adapter to the translator provide the force necessary to engage the cone-shaped seal (hence the name "cone-and-thread seal"). These four bolts are each torqued to 60 N-m, so it will take quite some force to undo them (and to retighten them). It is recommended to remove the translator from the frame BEFORE attempting to loosen or tighten these bolts, to avoid bending or damaging structural parts of the equipment.
- Once the adapter bolts are loose, one should take great care to protect the "cone" surface on both the tip of the translator and the inverted "cone" surface on the inconel adapter. It is recommended to carefully guide the adapter off of the translator to avoid any scratching / rubbing on this surface.
- Because the adapter is rarely opened, it is recommended to do as much cleaning as possible at this point.

Opening the translator from the adapter side:

- There is a brass nut which hold the brass bearing holder inside the pressure tube. After corrosion in the furnace, this part typically looks green. This can be removed using a small wrench and shouldn't be too hard to remove (and thus shouldn't be tightened too hard upon reinstallation.) Finger tight is good enough.
- We currently do not have any good advice on how to remove the bearing holder from the pressure tube. ScIDre has recommended yanking on the shaft to "hammer" it out from behind using the magnet pack assembly at the base of the shaft inside the pressure tube, but this is particularly risky for breaking the magnet pack off of the shaft. 

Opening the translator from the motor side:

- There are four bolts, similar to the adapter side (see above) which can be removed in a similar fashion. Instead of mating to the inconel adapter, in this case they are mated to an inconel block called the "flange". This flange has a similar cone and thread seal, except the inverted cone leads to a dead end. Similar to when removing the adapter, one should take care to not scratch the sealing surface when removing the flange.
- Once the flange is removed, the shaft can be easily slid out the open end of the pressure tube. The first thing that will come out is the magnet back at the shaft's base, and then the shaft itself. The shaft is attracted to the exterior magnet pack, so be cautious as you remove it to protect it from snapping off the interior magnet pack at its base.
    
!!! warning
    The shaft is weakly attached to the interior magnet pack with a tiny pin joint. This is liable to breaking and is a cause for sending the translators back to Dresden for repairs ($$$). Take care of the shaft.

- Maybe the bearing holder can be hammered down and be drawn out the motor side... As of the writing of this article, this has not been attempted.
- To reinsert the shaft, there will be difficult in getting the shaft to slide directly into the center of the bearing holder at the opposite end of the pressure tube. This is because the exterior magnet pack always draws it to the wall of the pressure tube, making it difficult to guide it through the center. To solve this, we once tried taking a long, thin alumina rod and inserted it into the opposite end of the pressure tube (the adapter side). This long rod could then be pressed against the top end of the shaft and could guide the top end of the shaft away from the walls of the pressure tube. During this process, it is important to note the position of the exterior magnet pack. If it is in an inconvenient position, it will strongly pull the shaft toward the wall. It may also help to turn on rotation while attempting this.
