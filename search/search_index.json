It is made of nickel alloy 718 and was machined in the UCSB Physics Machine Shop by Andy Segale. Inconel 718 is an extremely strong and corrosion resistant alloy employed in the aerospace industry to design jet engine components which have to sustain the most demanding environments, including extremely high temperatures, pressures and oxidizing environments. It can be machined in its softened state and then precipitation hardened. After machining was completed at UCSB, the chamber was precipitation hardened by Solar Atmospheres of California (www.solaratm.com) who have the required equipment as well as extensive knowledge on heat treatment of specialized metal alloys. The chamber is equipped with seven \u00be\" NPT ports. These are for the windows which allow for the laser beam to penetrate into the chamber, and can be used to image the molten sample using semi-transparent mirrors which reflect out-of-plane lasers into the chamber. Threaded into these window ports are custom sight glasses which fetaure a replaceable, anti-reflection coated window which is held in place by an O-ring and a retaining ring of CuBe alloy UNSC17200, chosen for its corrosion resistance. The sight glass housings are made from Inconel 718. Pressure sealing The chamber can be attached to the drives via adapting pieces, also designed by Michael Aling and machined out of the Inconel 718 alloy. The reason for these adapting pieces is the following. The drives are sealed to the processing chamber via a coned high pressure metal-to-metal seal. This is machined directly into the end of the drive ends and cannot easily be replaced. Since a seal will have to be broken each time the sample is mounted / unmounted, a replaceable seal is paramount. We therefore designed an adapting piece which is permanently sealed to the drives via the coned seals. The adaptors in turn are sealed to the chamber via replaceable metal gasket seals, detailed in Sealing the Chamber . Water cooling The chamber is water-cooled \u2013 this is essential since otherwise it would get extremely hot which would severely compromise its structural integrity and resistance to oxidation, and high temperatures have been shown to melt the O-rings in the window housings and cause damage to the sapphire windows. It is therefore also equipped with several thermocouple ports in order to monitor the chamber temperature during growth runs. Structural Frame The chamber is directly attached to the linear guide shafts via a set of brackets. These were custom machined by the engineering machine shop according to designs by Michael Aling. An important note is regarding the general build of the setup. All components are attached directly or indirectly to the linear guide shafts which run the length of the instrument. The main attachment point is the chamber itself. Via its brackets it is attached to the guide shafts using face-mounted shaft collars ( McMaster ) which are tightened to the guide shafts. All other parts are now attached to the chamber itself. The reason for this design decision was to help with alignment - by having all other parts floating they have the required tolerance to self-align with the chamber.","title":"Furnace Design"},{"location":"about/#furnace-design","text":"","title":"Furnace Design"},{"location":"about/#chamber","text":"The main structural component of the high-pressure laser floating zone setup, designed by Michael Aling, is the inconel pressure chamber.

Each laser emits a wavelength of 1070 nm and is capable of reaching 200 W of highly collimated infrared light. This totals a whopping 1400 W of laser power, and just a few milliWatts can start a fire. The light is invisible, and thus can be incredibly dangerous. It is important to prioritize laser safety when working with these furnaces. Some quick do's and don'ts: Danger Do not bend the fiber optic cable, it is very fragile and has a minimum curvature that it can withstand. Do not allow any dust or dirt to obstruct the output of the laser optics. These particles can burn or melt the optics themselves. Laser optics Anti-reflection coatings Focusing optics In-plane viewing optics Laser safety There are several key components of laser safety in the Laser Lab. Firstly, the optics should always keep the beam in an enclosed space, such that minimal free laser light is able to leave the lens tubes and/or chamber. Secondly, the laser curtains should always be ( closed ) when the lasers are armed to emit any infrared light. This is evidenced by the green \"Start\" button being illuminated on the front housing of each laser unit. This does not necessarily mean they are emitting any infrared light - emission is indicated by the large orange LED bar on the front of each laser unit. Similarly, whenever the laser units are armed, occupants of the lab should be wearing laser safety goggles with optical density (OD) 6+ at 1070 nm. These are not strictly required when the laser curtains are closed but should certainly be worn at all times when the curtain is open and the lasers are armed (regardless of whether emission is on). Using the Laser Controller Software Starting the software Make sure all the laser units are turned on. Click the \"LOKII Laser Controller Project\" given by the following icon. The software should open and prompt for the creating of a logfile. If the logfile prompt does not pop up, this means that the software is not communicating correctly with the lasers and must be restarted. For testing / growth setup, a dummy logfile \"test.txt\" can be used. For a logged growth, create a new logfile following the naming convention of previous files to keep files organized. Example filename: \"20230515_Log100_Sr2IrO4_growth50.txt\" Basic LabVIEW working principles The LabVIEW software is built to run in a continunous while loop, which only stops when the large red button is pressed. The current step is indicated by the Step text box indicator on the top of the Laser Controller. While understanding the function of each step in the while loop is not important for the general user, the details can be found in a later section. The important thing to understand is that your actions in LabVIEW are not put into effect until the loop has completed the next full cycle . This results is some delays between, for example, when you click the Aiming Beam button and when the aiming beam actually turns on. Enabling communication with the lasers On the left hand side of the Laser Controller, there are 7 buttons enabling communication with each of the laser units, shown here: In the picture above, all lasers will receive commands as indicated by the illuminated green light on each button. When sending commands to a select few lasers, simply disable the corresponding button in this section. Using the aiming beam (visible red light) For sample alignment, beam alignment, and beam focusing, the lasers offer a visible red laser light source called the \"aiming beam\". This radiation is visible, and is relatively low power. While delivering lower power than the infrared light, direct eye contact with the aiming beam can still cause injury. To enable the aiming beam, enable communication with any of lasers 2, 3, 5, 6 or 7 and click the Aiming Beam button on the Laser Controller. Warning Avoid using the aiming beam on lasers 1 and 4 - the semi-transparent mirrors in front of the camera and pyrometer are transparent to this red light and the aiming beam will obstruct viewing on windows 1 and 4. Using the infrared beam (1070 nm light) For delivering heating power to a sample, use the infrared beam, which has a wavelength of 1070 nm and a maximum power output of 200 W. There are several steps to using the infrared beam. Press the green Start button on the front of each laser unit to arm the lasers for emission. You will hear the cooling fans spin up on each unit. This does not mean laser light is being emitted at this point, but laser goggles and curtains should be used at all times when the lasers are in this state (see Laser Safety ). Ensure that the proper filtering optics are in place: Notch filter (1064 nm) in front of the pyrometer Short pass filter in front of the camera If needed, a neutral density filter (options: ND1, ND2, ND4) to dim the image in front of the camera as well. Click Emission On . You should see the orange LED bar on the front of each laser unit flash three times and stay illuminated. This means that the infrared beam is emitting light - be cautious. Setting the laser output power Three tabs Set Power, Ramp Power, and Set Pulsing in the center of the laser controller are used as inputs to control the laser output power. Manually set a power Using the Set Power tab, enter a power in the Power (W) input field, and press the Set Power button to set the power. Warning This only sets the power for the lasers for which Laser Communication is enabled. The power setpoint for the other lasers will remain unmodified in this case. Automatic power ramping Using the Ramp Power tab, enter the desired power setpoint in the Target Power (W) field and a ramp rate (1 W/min is a safe value to start) in the Ramp Rate (W/min) field. Click Calculate Ramp to set the values and calculate a Ramp Time (min) displayed in the top right. With Emission on/off set to on, click Ramp! to begin ramping the power to the desired setpoint. The graph below shows the average output power among the seven lasers. The green Ramping indicator under the Ramp Time (min) indicator illuminates to bright green. To stop the ramp, click the small STOP button to the right of the Ramping indicator. This pauses the ramp at the current setpoint. Optionally, you may change the target power or the ramp rate when the ramp is stopped - to do so, simply enter new values and click the Calculate Ramp button to save these changes. To resume the ramp, click the Ramp! button. Once the setpoint reaches the target power, the ramp will stop automatically. Laser pulsing The laser units are equipped with an internal pulsing control which allows the beam to pulse at a chosen frequency with chosen pulse width. These are set using the Set Pulsing tab. In order for pulsing mode to actually emit light, a constant DC signal must be applied to terminals on the back of each laser unit. To accomplish this, a simple DC power supply rests near the top of the server rack. To enable, simply turn on the power switch on the left hand side of the DC Power Supply unit, and then send the DC signal by pressing the blue Output On/Off button on the front panel of the unit. Set a desired pulse width in ms by entering a value in the Pulse Width (ms) field and click Set Pulse Width . Click Pulsing on/off to enable the pulsing mode on the lasers - the Pulsing enabled: indicators near the lower left of the Laser Controller should glow orange for each laser (1 through 7) which has pulsing enabled. The default pulse frequency or Pulse Repetition Rate (Hz) as labeled in the Laser Controller software is 100 Hz - meaning that 100 pulses occur per second, equivalent to one pulse every 10 ms. The duty cycle is then controlled exclusively by the pulse width, meaning that a pulse with of 5 ms corresponds to a duty cycle = 50% as shown below. In the default configuration, the duty cycle can be calculated using the forumla \\(\\rm{Duty} = \\rm{Width}/10~\\rm{ms} \\times 100\\%\\) . Understanding the outputs / logfile Using the Laser Unit Touchscreens The touchscreen on the front of the laser units should be used sparingly, only for basic or absolutely necessary tasks such as turning on the aiming beam, enabling/disabling pulsing (\"Gate Mode\"), and for urgent needs to turn off emission / emergency shutoff.","title":"Laser Control"},{"location":"lasercontrol/#laser-control","text":"","title":"Laser Control"},{"location":"lasercontrol/#laser-components","text":"Each fiber laser consists of a control unit, a fiber optic cable, and collimating optics.

Computer 1 is mainly used for imaging, and Computer 2 is mainly used for controlling the lasers. These computers should usually be left on, and require occasional restarts. Both are remotely accessible via Google Remote Desktop on the wilsonlabucsb Google account. Lasers The seven laser units live in the server rack next to the furnace. In their \"off\" state, the key on the front of each unit is vertical. Turn each unit on by turning each of the seven keys clockwise. Lasers are numbered 1-7, with numbers that correspond to each of the windows on the furnace chamber. Laser Controller Software Each laser unit has a touchscreen that allows for full control of the laser, though we rarely use this feature and mainly control the lasers from Computer 2 using a custom Laser Controller Software built in LabVIEW. Start the software by clicking the LOKII logo (green heptagon), labled \"LOKII Laser Controller Project\". Note The software should prompt for the creation of a logfile. Otherwise, the program is not communicating correctly with the lasers and must be restarted. When doing preparation steps, feel free to save a \"dummy\" logfile, usually called \"test.txt\". Translators The translator control unit is located on the server rack, above the seven laser units. The translators are then controlled using a touchscreen monitor located to the right of Computer 2. Turn the translator unit on by flipping the red switch on the top right of the translator unit. The touchscreen monitor on the computer desk should begin turning on - if not, ensure that the monitor itself is powered on. Pyrometer The pyrometer is a remote-sensing thermometer that measures the temperature of the molten zone on the basis of its thermal radiation spectrum. The pyrometer is controlled via software on Computer 1 called \"DataTemp MultiDrop\". The pyrometer is located on Window 4 . Open DataTemp MultiDrop software. Open an \"Application Configuration\", which loads the correct ethernet configuration as well as the previously used arrangement of data readout windows and data graphs used on the desktop. The temperature reading can be performed using 1-color or 2-color modes: Monochrome models (1-color) for standard temperature measurement applications The 1-color mode is best for measuring the temperature of targets in areas where no sighting obstructions, either solid or gaseous, exist. Such 1-color mode is also best where the target completely fills the measurement spot. Ratio models (2-color) for specific temperature measurement applications Ratio pyrometers determine the object temperature by the ratio of two separate and overlapping infrared bands.

Place the seed rod into the seed rod holder and tighten the bottom three mounting set screws in equal increments (~1/4 turn of the Alan key). Care should be taken to keep the sample centered within the mount, though slight tilts are allowable at this point and may be corrected later using the other three mounting set screws.

Slide the bottom translator housing up so that the inconel adapter is flush with the bottom of the chamber. Turn the aiming beam on. With rotation enabled, use the Fast Gear to translate the tip of the seed rod into the beam.

Powder synthesis Typically powders are dried for at least 6 hours before this step. Grind powder using mortar and pestle or ball milling techniques until fine. Consider using a sieve to achieve uniformly fine powder. Warning If powder carries moisture or is coarse, it will likely not press as easily. Packing a rod Obtain a latex balloon from the balloon drawer (under the arc melter) - check the balloon for holes or damage. For intermediate synthesis steps where the powder is to be re-ground at a later step, use the large balloons. For preparation of rods for the four-mirror optical floating zone furnace, use the medium (6 mm diameter) balloons. For preparation of rods for the laser floating zone furnaces, use the small (4 mm diameter) balloons. Clean the outside of the balloon using water and a kimwipe - try to get rid of any white powder left on the latex. Dust off the balloon using house nitrogen in the fume hood - try to get rid of remaining dust and kimwipe fibers. Warning The outside surface of the balloon will be the surface in contact with the powder. Strive to keep this surface free from contamination. Take a Q-tip and snap off the tip with the cotton swab. Take the remaining wooden stick and use some sandpaper to round down both ends. Sandpaper can be found in the small drawers to the left of the diamond saw. Dust off any remaining wood fibers or dust from the wooden stick using the house nitrogen in the fume hood. Push the wooden stick into the closed end of the balloon, turning it inside out. Slowly continue pulling the stick through the balloon. Avoid cross-contaminating the clean outer surface with the white powder that coats the inner surface of the latex. Perform small movements as to avoid the balloon bunching up on itself. Shake the balloon to take out the wooden stick. Use a Q-tip and some IPA/EtOH to clean the inner lip of the balloon. Secure a funnel on the end of the balloon. Each material typically warrants its own, clean funnel to minimize cross-contamination. Pour some powder into the funnel - shake, tap, and massage until it reaches to the bottom of the balloon. Densify the powder at the bottom of the balloon by pinching and pulling towards the end of the balloon. Gently roll flat with a ruler (or other flat surface) to try to achieve a cylindrical shape. CHECK OFTEN As you're packing and rolling, check that the shape is cylindrical, with minimal thick bulges and thin necks. It is easier to correct mistakes as soon as they happen - once you have moved further, it will be near impossible to correct a mistake that happened earlier. Packing in gradual amounts should help with this. Once the cylinder seems satisfactory, roll flat one last time using the ruler and ensure that the rod is straight. Take the balloon off the funnel and rub the \"empty\" part of the balloon between your fingers to try to knock down any remaining powder stuck to the walls. Tie one knot in the balloon close to the end of the sample (within 2 cm is fine). Gently pinch to keep air pockets out of the sealed portion. Tie a second knot above the first knot - position is less critical here. Cut the excess balloon just above the second knot - this helps avoid contaminating other processes with the excess powder stuck to the interior walls of the excess latex. Pressing the rod using the Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) If pressing a floating zone rod (medium or small balloons), obtain a plastic straw of the same diameter. Medium balloons match the blue spatula-straws, and small balloons match the regular clear soda straws. Cut the straw to the same length as the rod, and slice the straw open lengthwise into two long halves. Place the rod into the straw and wrap both ends using pieces of tape. Leave a \"tab\" to facilitate removing the tape later. Tape this contraption onto the interior wall of the metal cylinder sample holder that belongs to the CIP. Unscrew the CIP plug. Ensure there is enough antifreeze (green fluid) inside the chamber, and leave the CIP valve fully open. Lower the metal cylinder into the chamber with long forceps, and release. Before replacing the plug, check that the O-ring is intact and sandwiched between the two copper backing rings. Screw the plug all the way in, at which point the end of the threads should be aligned with the \"arrow\" symbol inscribed in the top of the chamber. Unscrew the plug a quarter turn (90 \\(^{\\circ}\\) ) to reduce wear on the threads. Fully open the house air supply on the right side of the fume hood, and flip the green \"on\" knob on the front face of the CIP. Note Turning the \"on\" knob opens a valve that allows the house air to drive the liquid pump - it will be loud when it turns on! Check the sight glass on the top face of the CIP to verify that fluid is indeed being circulated. You should see a small bubble that is \"pulsing\" with each stroke of the pump. Tighten the CIP valve, being careful not to overtighten. As soon as it is tight enough, pressure will start to build. Once it reaches the desired pressure (max. pressure 47,500 psi), flip the green power knob to the \"off\" position. At this point, pressure should hold - if it doesn't gently tighten the CIP valve. You can turn off the air supply at this point. Wait the desired amount of hold time. For most samples, you can wait as little as 30 seconds. Gently crack open the CIP valve, allowing the pressure to drop smoothly down to zero. Once it is at zero, fully open the CIP valve. Use two metal rods to unscrew the CIP plug. Use long forceps to remove the metal cylinder from inside the CIP chamber. Be careful not to avoid rough motions and bumps as to avoid breaking the newly pressed rod. Bring the metal cylinder to the sink and rinse excess antifreeze off with tap water. Replace the CIP plug - no need to screw it on all the way, as long as objects can't fall into the chamber. Remove sample from cylinder, and wash off excess antifreeze with IPA/EtOH. Extracting the rod Note For large and medium balloons, you can get away with using a razor blade to slice open the length of the balloon, without using any support. The rod should be strong enough to hold itself together without cracking at these diameters. Use scissors to cut open the balloon near the sample. Obtain the \"sandbox\" extracting tool and fill groove with sand ( locally sourced ). Ensure sand bed is flat and uniform. Lay rod down into the sand bed, and ensure that sand uniformly supports the length of the rod. Obtain a piece of tape, and use de-static tool to prepare the tape before gently taping down the rod. Completely tape down the entire length of the rod. Obtain a curved razor blade and slowly cut down the length of the sample. As you go, peel the balloon left and right to release it from the rod. Once the balloon is mostly open (2 mm - 4 mm remaining), slice the tape to release the rod from the sand bed. Slowly pull the balloon off the sample, pulling as anti-parallel as possible (like peeling a banana). Tip Once pressed, the rod will not stay pressed for very long. Do not wait longer than a few hours to begin sintering the rod. If you need to store the rod in the interim for transportation, you can wrap it in a kimwipe and place it in a long centrifuge tube. Sintering the rod Several options exist for sintering floating zone rods. Box furnaces and tube furnaces : Use an alumina boat, preferably with some powder of similar composition acting as a \"powder bed\" to prevent any reaction between the alumina and your rod. In the ESB 3312 lab, the back wall of SentroTech furnaces can operate between 1100 \\(^\\circ\\) C and 1600 \\(^\\circ\\) C. The other box furnaces can operate between room temperature and approximately 1000 \\(^\\circ\\) C. Vertical Molysili Furnace : Located in the Quantum Structures Facility , specifically the crystal growth facility , the vertical furnace can be used to sinter rods at temperatures up to 1800 \\(^\\circ\\) in gas environments including flowing Ar and flowing O \\(_2\\) . For more information, see the SOP for the vertical furnace . Clean up! Wipe up any antifreeze on the countertops, it tends to never evaporate so it will stay there forever otherwise. Collect any sand and return it to the storage container. Although it can be reused for extracting samples, know that the sand is hazardous waste - it contains residual powder from many samples. Clean your funnel and keep for the next time you press the same material.","title":"Sample Preparation"},{"location":"sampleprep/#sample-preparation","text":"Sample preparation materials are located in the Wilson Lab, Engineering Science Building Room 3312.","title":"Sample preparation"},{"location":"sampleprep/#powder-synthesis","text":"Typically powders are dried for at least 6 hours before this step.

Drawings for the seal design can be found in the Laser Furnace Google Drive. Seal Rings The inconel seal rings can be purchased from Destec, and are stored in their square cardboard boxes. Each ring is given a serial number written on the box to track the use of different rings and to identify which rings are no longer suitable for use at the highest pressures. Each inconel seal ring is initially coated with a uniform layer of MoS \\(_2\\) . Upon sealing, both the MoS \\(_2\\) coating and the inconel itself are damaged. Seal rings are not meant to be reused - the metal-to-metal seal causes some level of deformation in the inconel at the sealing surface. However, they have a high reusability at 1,000 psi and a much more limited reusability (2 to 5 sealings) at 10,000 psi. After a ring has been used, the MoS \\(_2\\) can optionally be re-coated using one of two techniques: Pour some powdered MoS \\(_2\\) into the seal ring box and shake by hand. Uniformly spray coat the ring with MoS \\(_2\\) spray in a fume hood. Heat and chemical shield (shroud) The volatilization of material during growth cannot be completely mitigated by the application of high pressure, warranting the use of a heat and chemical shield inside the chamber to protect the chamber walls and windows from material ejected out of the molten zone. This is accomplished using a copper-beryllium (CuBe) shroud which consists of a shroud cup, lower shroud piece, cylindrical window, and upper shroud piece. Assembling the shroud and loading the sample Clean the top and bottom sealing surfaces using IPA/EtOH and a Kimwipe until the Kimwipe appears free of any residue, and place Destec sealing rings on the top face of the chamber and the top face of the lower translator. Shroud cup : The shroud cup sits at the very bottom of the lower inconel adapter, and is meant to prevent material entering into the neck of the pressure tube of the lower translator. It is also useful for catching bits of crystals that have fallen down after growth. The cup has a hole in the center to allow the translator shaft to pass through it, and because this hole has a relatively large diameter a stainless steel collar is usually placed around the translator shaft just on top of the shroud cup to limit powder falling into this gap. Place a collar and washer on the bottom translator shaft, about 5 mm below the notch meant to hold the seed rod. This washer is meant to catch falling debris. Mount the seed rod holder using the bottom set screw. Lower shroud : The lower shroud piece can be distinguished from the upper shroud piece because it has a sloped interior groove near the bottom end that mates with the top lip of the shroud cup. It is also slightly shorter than the upper shroud. Carefully place the lower shroud over the seed rod and down into the adapter to mate with the shroud cup. (It may be necessary to lower the seed rod in order to get the shroud over it.) There is a hole on the face of the shroud which should align with the gas outlet port on the chamber. Rotate the shroud until the hole is aligned. Cylindrical glass window : The cylindrical glass window for LOKII is simply a glass tube that has been diced to the correct height. There is no anti-reflective coating and thus the windows are relatively inexpensive. These windows get damaged over time, especially when in contact with hot volatile material. Danger There is a window specifically for LAPIS which is anti-reflection coated at 820 nm - do not use this one with LOKII! This AR-coated window has a visible coloration on the surface of the glass and is typically kept in a separate container. These are very expensive windows due to the cost of the coating (~>$1,000), so be very careful with them. Carefully slide the lower translator housing upward until the inconel adapter is flush with the bottom face of the chamber. (IMAGE!) Upper shroud : Similar to the lower shroud, except there is no sloped interior groove on the top end. This shroud piece also has a hole, which is meant to align with the inlet gas port on the chamber. Gently lower the upper shroud into the top opening of the chamber with the hole aligned, and the shroud will seat gently into the cylindrical glass window. Mount a washer and collar onto the upper translator shaft, about 5 mm above the notched region. Mount another washer and the upper half of the feed rod holder to the upper translator shaft, using the single set screw on the feed rod holder. Slide the upper translator housing down until the adapter is flush with the top face of the chamber. Be cautious to not allow the feed rod to collide with the seed rod. It helps to lower the seed rod beforehand. Check the alignment of the feed rod by rotating it in the beam. If not satisfactory, the alignment can be fixed by sliding up the upper translator housing and bending the inconel wire. Satisfactory alignment is more loosely defined for the feed rod than it is for the seed rod. Some precession is allowable, as the surface tension of the molten zone will keep the feed rod centered after joining the rods during growth. (Satisfactory alignment image) Sealing the Destec Clamps The Destec clamps are sealed using a set of four bolts and eight nuts. The nuts and bolts should be assembled as in the following image, where the bolt is flush with the nut on one side of the clamp and protruding past the nut on the opposite side. The nuts have two distinct faces: one side is flat and dull with some text, while the other side is shiny and curved and plain. The shiny, curved side needs to be oriented to face the clamps, and the dull, flat, labeled side needs to face away from the clamp. Tip It is recommended that the \"flush\" side be on the dominant-handed side of the user, as this is the side where the torque will need to be applied. (CLAMP IMAGE) Pre-assemble the clamp as shown below: Hold the clamps up to the chamber-translator interface and use two nuts to hold the clamp up. Insert the remaining two bolts + nuts. Gently tighten the four bolts until the clamps are parallel - this is determined visually and by approximately measuring the gap between the clamps using a finger. Once the clamps are aligned, firmly tighten them by hand. Obtain the 1-1/16\" wrench and the torque wrench with 1-1/16\" socket. Set the torque 23 ft-lbs. (Image) Tighten the first bolt a quarter-turn. If the position of the bolt does not allow for the full range of motion for a quarter turn, begin by placing the torque wrench at the \"end\" of the range of motion and then move it in reverse.

Seal rings are not meant to be reused - the metal-to-metal seal causes some level of deformation in the inconel at the sealing surface.

It is also useful for catching bits of crystals that have fallen down after growth. The cup has a hole in the center to allow the translator shaft to pass through it, and because this hole has a relatively large diameter a stainless steel collar is usually placed around the translator shaft just on top of the shroud cup to limit powder falling into this gap.

Each counterweight is equipped with a so-called \"handbrake\" which can be tightened to lock its position. Where and where not to grab Using the translator touchscreen Warning There are several important considerations when using the translators: Never allow the translators to reach their maximum translation limits. There are limit switches to automatically stop translation once these limits are reached, but they are not guaranteed to work and failure here can cause costly damage to the translator units. The translators should never translate without rotation enabled. Always MODIFY the automatic translation speed before enabling slow automatic translation - there is a software error that can lead to accidental fast translation if the speed has remained unmodified for an extended period of time. Specifically, we suspect that this occurs only after the 2-finger automatic fast gear mode (see below) has been used and the automatic translation speed has not been changed since this mode. The translators are controlled entirely via the touchscreen monitor next to the computers. Each of the buttons is used by tapping once, with the exception of the Fast Gear fast translation buttons which must be held down constantly. Sample rotation To enable rotation, simply tap the CW or CCW buttons and the shaft will begin to rotate. The default speed is 10 revolutions per minute, which can be adjusted by adding or subtracting values using the +/- buttons under the rpm readout. Warning It is recommended to avoid using the +/- 10 rpm buttons , as these can cause decoupling of the magnet pack and/or failure of the rotation motor. RPM limits There are two generations of translator units - the first generation has slightly thinner diameter lead screw and keyed shaft. These older models are thought to have an upper limit of 15 rpm, above which the rotation motor may not operate continuously. The second generation, having thicker lead screw and keyed shaft, has been demonstrated to work at speeds up to 30 rpm. Sample translation Fast Manual Translation To use fast manual translation, with rotation enabled, simply long-press the Fast Gear up/down arrows and the shaft will translate as long as the button is held down. Tip 2-finger automatic fast gear mode To long-press the Fast Gear buttons without needing to keep your finger on the screen, you may use a 1-finger press on the button followed by adding a second finger nearby on the screen, followed by releasing both fingers at the same time. Be cautious to not allow the fast gear to take the translator motors to their extreme limits - keep watch of the translators in this mode and tap the button again to disable. Slow Automatic Translation To use slow automatic translation, set a translation speed in mm/hr using the +/- buttons under the speed readout. See warning at the top of this page about errors that can cause the software to accidentally ignore this speed and \"fast move\". Then, with rotation enabled, tap the Automatic up/down buttons to begin translation. Other considerations Changing pressure too quickly Changing the pressure too quickly can violently force the translator shaft in or out of the pressure tube, decoupling it from the magnet pack and potentially damaging equipment / samples. Always pressurizing and depressurize slowly to avoid this.
