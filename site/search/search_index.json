It is made of nickel alloy 718 and was machined in the UCSB Physics Machine Shop by Andy Segale. Inconel 718 is an extremely strong and corrosion resistant alloy employed in the aerospace industry to design jet engine components which have to sustain the most demanding environments, including extremely high temperatures, pressures and oxidizing environments. It can be machined in its softened state and then precipitation hardened. After machining was completed at UCSB, the chamber was precipitation hardened by Solar Atmospheres of California (www.solaratm.com) who have the required equipment as well as extensive knowledge on heat treatment of specialized metal alloys. The chamber is equipped with seven \u00be\" NPT ports. These are for the windows which allow for the laser beam to penetrate into the chamber, and can be used to image the molten sample using semi-transparent mirrors which reflect out-of-plane lasers into the chamber. Threaded into these window ports are custom sight glasses which fetaure a replaceable, anti-reflection coated window which is held in place by an O-ring and a retaining ring of CuBe alloy UNSC17200, chosen for its corrosion resistance. The sight glass housings are made from Inconel 718. Pressure sealing The chamber can be attached to the drives via adapting pieces, also designed by Michael Aling and machined out of the Inconel 718 alloy. The reason for these adapting pieces is the following. The drives are sealed to the processing chamber via a coned high pressure metal-to-metal seal. This is machined directly into the end of the drive ends and cannot easily be replaced. Since a seal will have to be broken each time the sample is mounted / unmounted, a replaceable seal is paramount. We therefore designed an adapting piece which is permanently sealed to the drives via the coned seals. The adaptors in turn are sealed to the chamber via replaceable metal gasket seals, detailed in Sealing the Chamber . Water cooling The chamber is water-cooled \u2013 this is essential since otherwise it would get extremely hot which would severely compromise its structural integrity and resistance to oxidation, and high temperatures have been shown to melt the O-rings in the window housings and cause damage to the sapphire windows. It is therefore also equipped with several thermocouple ports in order to monitor the chamber temperature during growth runs. Structural Frame The chamber is directly attached to the linear guide shafts via a set of brackets. These were custom machined by the engineering machine shop according to designs by Michael Aling. An important note is regarding the general build of the setup. All components are attached directly or indirectly to the linear guide shafts which run the length of the instrument. The main attachment point is the chamber itself. Via its brackets it is attached to the guide shafts using face-mounted shaft collars ( McMaster ) which are tightened to the guide shafts. All other parts are now attached to the chamber itself. The reason for this design decision was to help with alignment - by having all other parts floating they have the required tolerance to self-align with the chamber.","title":"Furnace Design"},{"location":"about/#furnace-design","text":"","title":"Furnace Design"},{"location":"about/#chamber","text":"The main structural component of the high-pressure laser floating zone setup, designed by Michael Aling, is the inconel pressure chamber.

Issue: Shaft vibrates when rotating. Solution: Lubricate the length of the translator shaft with MoS \\(_2\\) - grab a small vial and pour in a small amount of MoS \\(_2\\) powder. Add some IPA or EtOH to create a suspension and sonicate to mix. Issue: Shaft is fully retracted into the translator housing. Solution: You will need to take off the rear flange from the opposite end of the translator. This involves undoing the large four bolts that hold the cone and thread seal and lock the dead flange in place. Be very careful to do the untightening evenly, as to keep the force on the cone-shaped sealing surface relatively balanced. As the flange begins to loosen, pull it away from the cone-shaped sealing surface as any scratches to this surface will cause a very expensive leak. You can use a long thin object (like a wooden dowel) to push the shaft back up and out into its normal position. If you have trouble getting the shaft to line up with the bearing holder (which should have a tight tolerance), you can use another thin, long object from the other end of the translator to try to nudge the shaft into the center of the bearing so it can pass through. Issue: Shaft has disconnected from magnet pack Solution: Send it back to SciDre for repair. Issue: Shaft does not translate smoothly but gets stuck as it moves. Solution: Similar to the issue of vibration during shaft rotation - need to lubricate the shaft with MoS \\(_2\\) . Issue: Chamber repeatedly leaks at the seal rings. Solution: If this issue persists even after replacing with fresh sesal rings, check the alignment of the Inconel adapters with the chamber. You can do this using a straightedge up against the sides of the adapter/chamber where the sealing surfaces meet, or by attempting to slide a piece of weigh paper in the gap between the adapter and chamber in an attempt to feel if the gap is bigger on one side more than another. Either the adapter is not mounted straight onto the translator, or the entire translator+adapter assembly is not mounted coaxial with the chamber. Remounting of these parts may be necessary. Issue: The lasers are not communicating, they sometimes disconnect, or the LabVIEW software is stuck at the \"read values\" step. Solution: Try restarting the LabVIEW software. See instructions on how to do this in the \"Using the Lasers\" SOP. Issue: I tried to do automatic translation and the shaft moved as if I touched the fast gear button, even though the speed I had set for the automatic mode was slow. Solution: This is a known bug in the translator software. This occurs if you use the \"2-finger touch trick\" to hold down the fast gear button (without having to hold your finger there the whole time), and if your next action is to enable automatic translation. The key is to do an intermediate step before enabling automatic translation. For example, after using the \"2-finger touch trick\", you should arbitrarily press any +/- key to change the automatic translation speed (you can, for example add 0.1 mm/hr and then subtract 0.1 mm/hr). Now, because there was some intermediate action, you should have no problem enabling the automatic mode. In any case, it is safest to turn on automatic translation in a \"harmless\" direction. For example, begin translating the seed downwards or the feed upwards, so that you don't accidentally crash the feed and seed into each other if you run into this bug. The worst that could happen is that this bug appears and they move unexpectedly fast, but in a safe direction. Issue: The logfile prompt on the LabVIEW software is not appearing / the lasers are not responding or connecting to PC2. Solution: If none of the lasers are successfully communicating with PC2, try restarting the Netgear box by unplugging its power supply and then reconnecting. If that doesn't work, try verifying that each individual laser is working correctly by directly connecting an ethernet cable between the computer and ONE laser and try pinging that laser's IP address from the command prompt using \"ping 192.168.3.23X\" where X is the laser number.

controlled by two PCs. Computer 1 is mainly used for imaging, and Computer 2 is mainly used for controlling the lasers. These computers should usually be left on, and require occasional restarts. Both are remotely accessible via Google Remote Desktop on the wilsonlabucsb Google account. Lasers The seven laser units live in the server rack next to the furnace. In their \"off\" state, the key on the front of each unit is vertical. Turn each unit on by turning each of the seven keys clockwise. Lasers are numbered 1-7, with numbers that correspond to each of the windows on the furnace chamber. Laser Controller Software Each laser unit has a touchscreen that allows for full control of the laser, though we rarely use this feature and mainly control the lasers from Computer 2 using a custom Laser Controller Software built in LabVIEW. Start the software by clicking the LOKII logo (green heptagon), labled \"LOKII Laser Controller Project\". Note The software should prompt for the creation of a logfile. Otherwise, the program is not communicating correctly with the lasers and must be restarted. When doing preparation steps, feel free to save a \"dummy\" logfile, usually called \"test.txt\". Translators The translator control unit is located on the server rack, above the seven laser units. The translators are then controlled using a touchscreen monitor located to the right of Computer 2. Turn the translator unit on by flipping the red switch on the top right of the translator unit. The touchscreen monitor on the computer desk should begin turning on - if not, ensure that the monitor itself is powered on. Pyrometer The pyrometer is a remote-sensing thermometer that measures the temperature of the molten zone on the basis of its thermal radiation spectrum. The pyrometer is controlled via software on Computer 1 called \"DataTemp MultiDrop\". The pyrometer is located on Window 4 . Open DataTemp MultiDrop software. Open an \"Application Configuration\", which loads the correct ethernet configuration as well as the previously used arrangement of data readout windows and data graphs used on the desktop. The temperature reading can be performed using 1-color or 2-color modes: Monochrome models (1-color) for standard temperature measurement applications The 1-color mode is best for measuring the temperature of targets in areas where no sighting obstructions, either solid or gaseous, exist. Such 1-color mode is also best where the target completely fills the measurement spot. Ratio models (2-color) for specific temperature measurement applications Ratio pyrometers determine the object temperature by the ratio of two separate and overlapping infrared bands. The 2-color mode is best for measuring the temperature of targets that are partially obscured, either intermittently or permanently by other objects, openings, screens, or viewing windows that reduce energy, and by dirt, smoke, or steam in the atmosphere. The 2-color mode can also be used on targets that do not completely fill the measurement spot, provided the background is much cooler than the target. Ratio pyrometers can measure and determine the object temperature in either one of both modes (1-color / 2-color), in which always 2 infrared detectors are active. See the manual from Fluke Process Instruments for more details. Camera The camera is controlled by software on Computer 1 called \"Pylon Viewer\". Open \"Pylon Viewer\" Open Window > Devices > Baseler acA1300. Click the \"Continuous Shot\" button to enable video feed. Note The camera image is significantly darker than the pyrometer image when the furnace is not actively running. Open Window > Features - All > Acquisition Controls > Exposure Time. Use large values (100,000 ms) for setup and lower values (1,000 - 10,000 ms) during growth. Note The frame rate will suffer greatly at high exposure times. It is recommended to use no higher than 100,000 ms, else the image will be \"choppy\". If the frame rate drops to 0 frames per second (fps), simply press \"Stop\" and \"Continuous Shot\" to restart video acquisition. Mass Flow Controller The mass flow controller is controlled by two different programs on Computer 2 , called FlowDDE and FlowPlot . Open FlowDDE and click Communication > Open communication. Open FlowPlot and click \"Start\". Use the \"Select setpoint (%)\" menu to set a flowrate. 100% corresponds to 10 standard liters per minute (SLM) of Ar flow. For other gases, there is a conversion factor calculator available on the Bronkhorst website . Thermocouples The thermocouples are read using a thermocouple reader box which is connected to Computer 2 via USB connection. Open DP1001AM and click Setting > Port and set to COM6 (subject to change). Click \"Connect\" and all three thermocouples should provide a reading. Each reading corresponds to a region of the chamber as follows: Channel 1: Window 6 Channel 2: Window 3 Channel 3: Window 1 These ports are all at different distances from the central chamber bore as specified in the chamber drawings . Pressure Gauge Viewer The pressure gauge at the outlet is monitored by a Logitech Webcam connected to Computer 2 . Open Logitech Software to view the camera. Physically adjust the webcam to capture at least the range 0 psi to 10,000 psi. Growth Logs Open the Growth Logs folder on Google Drive. Copy an existing log and maintain the naming scheme to keep files organized. See existing logs for examples - keep a good record of growth details. Images can also be included. Screen Recorder Both computers are equipped with OBS Studio , a free screen recording software. Open OBS Studio, and ensure that it is focused on the monitor you wish to record.

Section I: Laser collimators Assemble the Thorlabs parts as shown below. The green electrical tape is needed because the diameters don't quite match between the collimator and the slip ring. There are a few key considerations that can lead to errors: Considerations First, the metal posts must sit at the very bottom of the post holders, else there will be a slight vertical tilt to the collimator. Second, The slip rings must be tightened firmly to the metal posts, else they will rotate and the collimator will have the freedom to move side to side after mounting. It is recommended that you place a long Alan key in the small hole in the side of the metal posts, just to have something to hold on to, then try tightening the slip ring onto the metal post as firmly as you can. Third, the thumbscrew that tightens the metal post into the post holder must be tightened quite firmly, and for this it is necessary to use a hex wrench or Alan key into the center of the thumbscrew. If the thumbscrew happens to be near the small hole on the metal post, tightening the thumb screw may cause the post to rotate slightly and the thumbscrew will seat itself (undesiredly) into the hole. In these cases it is useful to detach the post holder from the rail carrier (there is a screw underneath the rail carrier that can be loosened), and then rotate the post holder until the thumbscrew will no longer be near the hole in the side of the metal post. Section II: Lens arrays The lens arrays have a single cylindrical plano-convex lens (AR coated to 1070 nm) which is oriented so that the only focusing is in the vertical direction. These lenses are mounted inside a 1\" lens tube using a retaining ring, which can be unscrewed using the red Thorlabs spanner wrench (SPW602). The laser light should be incident on the cylidrical side and the flat side should be facing the chamber. It is imperative to minimize the gaps where light can escape between the laser and the chamber, so the lens tube should be flush with the collimator on one side and flush with the window block on the other side. Section III: In-Plane Viewing Optics Arrays The in-plane viewing optics arrays are located on windows (lasers) 1 and 4 of the chamber. [Work in progress] Place round laser line mirror in holder, tighten nylon tip set screws carefully to not crack mirror. Do the same with rectangular dichroic mirror. Use three thumbscrews to attach the two plates to each other. Be mindful of the mirror sitting between them, be careufl not to smack it into the metal. The circular clamp is first placed on the window as shown below, and tightened using set screws on the shoulder. These should be tightened evenly, because if one is sticking out more than the other, then it will prevent the next clamp from sitting flush around the circular outer diameter. The next clamp is a square piece with a ciruclar cut-out in the middle, which mounts onto the circular clamp which should already be installed on the window. This clamp is tightened using two shoulder screws. It is imperative that these are secure, because if these fall off at any point while the lasers are on, that could be a dangerous situation. Next, there is a lens tube that can screw onto the top face of the assembly of the two plates. The distance of the lens from the bottom of the tube controls the size of the spot at the sample position. Make sure that the lens and the tube are mounted at an angle where the lens focuses the light exclusively in the vertical direction. This can take a few tries to get right: it is recommended to install the lens tube onto the plate assembly first (without the lens inside). Then, with the lens tube secure and unable to rotate freely, install the lens in the correct orientation and tighten the retaining rings. Next, there is a 45-degree kinematic mount from Thorlabs that holds a round, broad-band mirror which can be rotated along two axes in the mount. This is then followed by a custom aluminum piece that uses Thorlabs slip rings to hold onto the IPG Photonics collimating optics at the end of the laser fiber. After assembly, metal shards from the threads of various parts can fall onto the lenses and mirrors. Carefully blow away (using \"canned air\") any particulates off the surface of these optics to avoid local heating and melting of these parts. Ensure that this is done before the beam is first turned on.","title":"Aligning the laser optics"},{"location":"advanced/alignlasers/#aligning-the-laser-optics","text":"This tutorial assumes the laser optics are almost completely disassembled.","title":"Aligning the laser optics"},{"location":"advanced/alignlasers/#section-i-laser-collimators","text":"Assemble the Thorlabs parts as shown below.

Opening from each end has its advantages in certain situations. Removing the inconel adapter: The adapter can be removed using a 15/16\" wrench and a 14 mm hex attachment to the square drive on the torque wrench. The four large hex drive bolts that hold the adapter to the translator provide the force necessary to engage the cone-shaped seal (hence the name \"cone-and-thread seal\"). These four bolts are each torqued to 60 N-m, so it will take quite some force to undo them (and to retighten them). It is recommended to remove the translator from the frame BEFORE attempting to loosen or tighten these bolts, to avoid bending or damaging structural parts of the equipment. Once the adapter bolts are loose, one should take great care to protect the \"cone\" surface on both the tip of the translator and the inverted \"cone\" surface on the inconel adapter. It is recommended to carefully guide the adapter off of the translator to avoid any scratching / rubbing on this surface. Because the adapter is rarely opened, it is recommended to do as much cleaning as possible at this point. Opening the translator from the adapter side: There is a brass nut which hold the brass bearing holder inside the pressure tube. After corrosion in the furnace, this part typically looks green. This can be removed using a small wrench and shouldn't be too hard to remove (and thus shouldn't be tightened too hard upon reinstallation.) Finger tight is good enough. We currently do not have any good advice on how to remove the bearing holder from the pressure tube. ScIDre has recommended yanking on the shaft to \"hammer\" it out from behind using the magnet pack assembly at the base of the shaft inside the pressure tube, but this is particularly risky for breaking the magnet pack off of the shaft. Opening the translator from the motor side: There are four bolts, similar to the adapter side (see above) which can be removed in a similar fashion. Instead of mating to the inconel adapter, in this case they are mated to an inconel block called the \"flange\". This flange has a similar cone and thread seal, except the inverted cone leads to a dead end. Similar to when removing the adapter, one should take care to not scratch the sealing surface when removing the flange. Once the flange is removed, the shaft can be easily slid out the open end of the pressure tube. The first thing that will come out is the magnet pack at the shaft's base, and then the shaft itself. The shaft is attracted to the exterior magnet pack (e.g., the shaft will be strongly pulled towards the walls of the tube) if it has slipped below the narrow-diameter bearing holder which keeps it centered, so be cautious as you remove it to protect it from snapping off the interior magnet pack at its base. Warning The shaft is weakly attached to the interior magnet pack with a tiny pin joint. This is liable to breaking and is a cause for sending the translators back to Dresden for repairs ($$$). Take care of the shaft. Maybe the bearing holder can be hammered down and be drawn out the motor side... As of the writing of this article, this has not been attempted. To reinsert the shaft, there will be difficult in getting the shaft to slide directly into the center of the bearing holder at the opposite end of the pressure tube. This is because the exterior magnet pack always draws it to the wall of the pressure tube, making it difficult to guide it through the center. To solve this, we once tried taking a long, thin alumina rod and inserted it into the opposite end of the pressure tube (the adapter side). This long rod could then be pressed against the top end of the shaft and could guide the top end of the shaft away from the walls of the pressure tube. During this process, it is important to note the position of the exterior magnet pack. If it is in an inconvenient position, it will strongly pull the shaft toward the wall. It may also help to turn on rotation while attempting this. Resealing the cone and thread seals: The following steps are written assuming that you chose to open the adapter side rather than the motor side. If you chose the motor side, just follow the instructions for tightening the bolts and don't worry too much about the alignment. The bolts should still be evenly tightened, but in this case we do not have to worry about the flange -translator alignment (in contrast to the adapter -translator alignment, which is important). To re-seal the adapter, first ensure that all parts are re-installed and that the sealing surfaces have been cleaned using a clean Kimwipe and alcohol. Place the translator on the floor with the adapter side facing upward. It may be necessary to rest the flange on a block of wood or metal, in order to keep the weight off of the motor housings. A convenient object to use as a base for this purpose would be an old-generation adapter, which should have the exact same dimensions. Carefully place the adapter onto the cone sealing surface, being careful not to cause any rubbing motions that could result in scratches. Try to place it such that the shaft is in the exact center of the adapter. The flat sides of the adapter also need to be perfectly parallel to the corresponding face on the translator. This can be aided by using a flat metal piece that can be affixed to the threaded holes on the side of the adapter using a bolt. Insert all four bolts and tighten them by hand evenly such that the shaft remains in the center of the adapter. Set the torque wrench to 60 N-m. Using a torque wrench with the 14 mm hex drive attachment and a 15/16\" wrench, tighten the bolts in a star pattern by giving each bolt a small turn, say 1/8 of a rotation. A 30-degree turn seemed to work well. This helps ensure that the shaft remains in the center. Stop once all bolts have reached 60 N-m. If this is the upper translator, place the translator on top of the chamber (assuming the chamber is mounted on the frame) and carefully center the adapter such that the adapter and chamber interface is perfectly flush and centered. Next, examine the position of the translator. Particularly, examine the relative positions of the upper crossbar holes relative to the corresponding holes on the translator. These should be perfectly aligned. If they are not, there are two \"modes\" of offsets that could be happening: The holes on the translator are too far to the left or right. In this case the adapter is tilted slightly to either the left or right sides. The crossbar is \"pushing\" on the translator or there is a gap between the crossbar and the translator. In this case, the adapter is tilted slightly to the front or the back. In either case, the tilt needs to be fixed. To do this, first loosen two bolts by 1/8 of a turn on the side where the angle between the adapter and translator is < 180 degrees. Then, tighten the opposite two bolts to the full 60 N-m. Then return to the first two bolts and re-tighten them to 60 N-m as well. Re-check the alignment of the translator (it should have improved!), and repeat until the corrections have reached an optimum position for the translator.","title":"Opening/sealing the translators"},{"location":"advanced/preparenewinconel/","text":"Preparing newly machined Inconel 718 When the Inconel is fresh from the machine shop, it will be contaminated with machining oil and dirt.

Each laser emits a wavelength of 1070 nm and is capable of reaching 200 W of highly collimated infrared light. This totals a whopping 1400 W of laser power, and just a few milliwatts can start a fire. The light is invisible, and thus can be incredibly dangerous. It is important to prioritize laser safety when working with these furnaces. Some quick do's and don'ts: Danger Do not bend the fiber optic cable, it is very fragile and has a minimum curvature that it can withstand. Do not allow any dust or dirt to obstruct the output of the laser optics. These particles can burn or melt the optics themselves. Laser optics Anti-reflection coatings Focusing optics In-plane viewing optics Laser safety There are several key components of laser safety in the Laser Lab. Firstly, the optics should always keep the beam in an enclosed space, such that minimal free laser light is able to leave the lens tubes and/or chamber. Secondly, the laser curtains should always be ( closed ) when the lasers are armed to emit any infrared light. This is evidenced by the green \"Start\" button being illuminated on the front housing of each laser unit. This does not necessarily mean they are emitting any infrared light - emission is indicated by the large orange LED bar on the front of each laser unit. Similarly, whenever the laser units are armed, occupants of the lab should be wearing laser safety goggles with optical density (OD) 6+ at 1070 nm. These are not strictly required when the laser curtains are closed but should certainly be worn at all times when the curtain is open and the lasers are armed (regardless of whether emission is on). Using the Laser Unit Touchscreens The touchscreen on the front of the laser units should be used sparingly, only for basic or absolutely necessary tasks such as turning on the aiming beam, enabling/disabling pulsing (\"Gate Mode\"), and for urgent needs to turn off emission / emergency shutoff.","title":"Laserinfo"},{"location":"img/laserinfo/#section-vii-laser-components","text":"Each fiber laser consists of a control unit, a fiber optic cable, and collimating optics.

For more detailed information about the laser units (including binary commands, pinout diagrams, etc.) see the IPG Laser User Guide . Section I: Startup Turn the key on the front of each laser unit to the \"ON\" position. The touchscreen on each laser should turn on. Click the \"LOKII Laser Controller Project\" on the taskbar. The software should open and prompt for the creation of a logfile. Warning If the logfile prompt does not pop up, this means that the software is not communicating correctly with the lasers and must be restarted. When not being used for a growth, a dummy logfile \"test.txt\" can be used. For a growth, create a new logfile following the naming convention of previous files to keep files organized. Example filename: \"20230515_Log100_Sr2IrO4_growth50.txt\" The log number is determined by the numbering of the logfiles in the Growth Logs folder in the LOKII Google Drive . The growth number is determined by how many times this material has been grown in the furnace. Section II: Basic LabVIEW working principles The LabVIEW software is built to run in a continunous while loop, which only stops when the large red STOP ( ) button is pressed. The current step is indicated by the Step text box indicator on the top of the Laser Controller. While understanding the function of each step in the while loop is not important for the general user, the details can be found in a later section. The important thing to understand is that your actions in LabVIEW are not put into effect until the loop has completed the next full cycle . This results is some delays between, for example, when you click the Aiming Beam button and when the aiming beam actually turns on. Section III: Enabling communication with the lasers On the left hand side of the Laser Controller, there are 7 buttons enabling communication with each of the laser units, shown here: In the scenario pictured above, all lasers will receive commands as indicated by the illuminated green light on each button. In the case that you want to send a command to a select few lasers, only enable the communication button for those lasers, and disable communication for the rest. Example Section IV: Using the aiming beam (visible red light) For sample alignment, beam alignment, and beam focusing, the lasers offer a visible red laser light source called the \"aiming beam\". This radiation is visible, and is relatively low power. While this red light is not as powerful as the infrared light, it can still cause damage to the eyes. To enable the aiming beam, enable communication with any of lasers 2, 3, 5, 6 or 7 and click the Aiming Beam button on the Laser Controller. Tip Avoid using the aiming beam on lasers 1 and 4. Here, the semi-transparent mirrors in front of the camera and pyrometer are transparent to this red light and the aiming beam will effectively blind the camera on windows 1 and the pyrometer on window 4. Section V: Using the infrared beam (1070 nm light) For delivering heating power to a sample, use the infrared beam, which has a wavelength of 1070 nm and a maximum power output of 200 W. There are several steps to using the infrared beam. Press the green Start button on the front of each laser unit to arm the lasers for emission. You will hear the cooling fans spin up on each unit. This does not mean laser light is being emitted at this point, but laser goggles and curtains should be used at all times when the lasers are in this state (see Laser Safety ). Ensure that the proper filtering optics are in place: The pyrometer requires a notch filter (blocks light near 1064 nm) The camera requires a short pass filter (allows wavelengths shorter than 750 nm to be transmitted) and, if desired, a neutral density filter (options: ND1, ND2, ND4 (darkest)) to dim the intensity of all wavelengths of light Verify that the Current Setpoint (%) is at the expected value before turning Emission On . RCS: 0.0 means that the setpoint is 0% of the total current (equivalent to a power of 0 watts), and RCS: 100.0 means that the setpoint is 100% of the total current (equivalent to the maximum power of 200 watts). Typically, the lasers should be at RCS: 0.0 before you click Emission On . Perform a safety check before turning on emission: Laser safety sign attached to door Laser safety goggles on Laser curtains closed All lasers and optics securely attached to furnace Current Setpoint (%) at expected value Click Emission On . You should see the orange LED bar on the front of each laser unit flash three times and stay illuminated. This means that the infrared beam is emitting light - be cautious. Section VI: Setting the laser output power Warning These commands only set the power for the lasers for which Laser Communication is enabled. The power setpoint for the other lasers will remain unmodified in this case. Three tabs Set Power, Ramp Power, and Set Pulsing in the center of the laser controller are used as inputs to control the laser output power. Set Power : Manually choose setpoint Using the Set Power tab, enter a power in the Power (W) input field, and press the Set Power button to set the power. Ramp Power : Automatic power ramping Using the Ramp Power tab, enter the desired power setpoint in the Target Power (W) field and a ramp rate (1 W/min is a safe value to start) in the Ramp Rate (W/min) field. Click Calculate Ramp to set the values and calculate a Ramp Time (min) displayed in the top right. With Emission on/off set to on, click Ramp! to begin ramping the power to the desired setpoint. The graph below shows the average output power among the seven lasers. The green Ramping indicator under the Ramp Time (min) indicator illuminates to bright green. To stop the ramp, click the small STOP button to the right of the Ramping indicator. This pauses the ramp at the current setpoint. Optionally, you may change the target power or the ramp rate when the ramp is stopped - to do so, simply enter new values and click the Calculate Ramp button to save these changes. To resume the ramp, click the Ramp! button. Once the setpoint reaches the target power, the ramp will stop automatically. Set Pulsing : Reduce laser power by pulsing laser on/off The laser units are equipped with an internal pulsing control which allows the beam to pulse at a chosen frequency with chosen pulse width. These are set using the Set Pulsing tab. In order for pulsing mode to actually emit light, a constant DC signal must be applied to terminals on the back of each laser unit. To accomplish this, a simple DC power supply rests near the top of the server rack. To enable, simply turn on the power switch on the left hand side of the DC Power Supply unit, and then send the DC signal by pressing the blue Output On/Off button on the front panel of the unit. Set a desired pulse width in ms by entering a value in the Pulse Width (ms) field and click Set Pulse Width . Click Pulsing on/off to enable the pulsing mode on the lasers - the Pulsing enabled: indicators near the lower left of the Laser Controller should glow orange for each laser (1 through 7) which has pulsing enabled. The default pulse frequency or Pulse Repetition Rate (Hz) as labeled in the Laser Controller software is 100 Hz - meaning that 100 pulses occur per second, equivalent to one pulse every 10 ms. The duty cycle is then controlled exclusively by the pulse width, meaning that a pulse with of 5 ms corresponds to a duty cycle = 50% as shown below. In the default configuration, the duty cycle can be calculated using the forumla \\(\\rm{Duty} = \\rm{Width}/10~\\rm{ms} \\times 100\\%\\) . Section VII: Restarting the laser controller software while using lasers If you choose to restart the laser controller software, you should NOT close the window but instead use either the \"stop sign\" icon in the LabVIEW toolbar OR the \"STOP\" button on the front panel of the laser controller itself. After this, the front panel should remain open but the program should be stopped. At this point, the safest thing to do is to disable communication with all seven lasers before clicking the \"Run\" (arrow symbol) button in the LabVIEW toolbar. This ensures that, when the program starts up, it does not send a set of unintentional commands to the lasers which might have unintended consequences (e.g., it might turn the lasers off mid-growth).","title":"Using the lasers"},{"location":"sops/lasercontrol/#using-the-lasers","text":"Purpose : To give users an overview of how to use the lasers during a typical growth.

This MFC is calibrated for Ar at 1300 psi (90 bar) with a flow range of .2 \u2013 10 ls/min (standard liters per minute = at 20 \u00b0C and 1 atm). There are several use-cases for the MFC: You are flowing Ar and the regulator is set to 1300 psi (calibration condition) = MFC can be set by directly converting % to flow rate using the calibrated flow range. So, 10% = 1 ls/min, 50% = 5 ls/min and so on. Anything in the range (0%,.2%] would presumably yield the minimum flow of .2 ls/min. You are flowing Ar, but at a lower pressure than 1300 psi = use conversion factor from Fluidat (see below), then convert to % in the same way. You are flowing N2, regardless of the outlet pressure from the regulator = use conversion factor from Fluidat (see below), then convert to % in the same way. Using Fluidat Fluidat is a program provided by Bronkhorst that allows for calculation of gas conversion factors. These factors allow one to provide an equivalent mass flow of a gas different from the one the MFC has been calibrated for. The calibrated gas is directly connected to the % value set in FlowPlot, as described above, but the conversion factor must be applied for a different gas.

Place the seed rod into the seed rod holder and tighten the bottom three mounting set screws in equal increments (~1/4 turns). Care should be taken to keep the sample centered within the mount, though slight tilts are allowable at this point and may be corrected in the next step, using the other three mounting set screws. The bottom of the seed rod must be above the interior ledge within the seed rod holder. This ledge rests atop the translator shaft - otherwise the seed rod itself will collide with the translator shaft first, and this can cause damage to the seed rod. Tighten the top three set screws until they are gently touching the seed rod. These will be used to optimize the sample tilt, such that there is no precession about the central axis when it rotates. Section II: Aligning the seed rod Assess and correct the precession of the seed rod - this can be done in any way you see fit, but the following technique is recommended: Place the seed rod holder onto the bottom translator shaft and attach using the single set screw on the bottom of the seed rod holder. Slide the bottom translator housing up towards the chamber. Turn the aiming beam on for all lasers except lasers 1 and 4. With rotation enabled, use the Fast Gear to translate the tip of the seed rod into the beam. Allow the sample to rotate in the beam and use tape to mark the maximum leftward and rightward positions of the seed rod. Stop the rotation at the moment when the rod is at the rightmost (or leftmost) position. Slide the bottom translator housing down so that the sample is accessible. Identify the direction in which the rod is tilted, based on whether it was at the rightmost or leftmost extreme. Keep track of this direction as you remove the sample from the shaft. Gently loosen the screws opposite the direction of the unwanted displacement, and then gently tighten the screws that lie along the direction of the unwanted displacement to remedy it. Replace the seed rod onto the shaft and repeat until precession at the tip of the rod has been eliminated. Section III: Mounting the feed rod The feed rod is mounted in essentially the same manner as the seed rod. However, the standard for minimizing precession using the mounting set screws is not as critical here, as minor adjustments can be made by manipulating the bend of the wire connecting the two holder pieces.

Powder synthesis Typically powders are dried for at least 6 hours before this step. Grind powder using mortar and pestle or ball milling techniques until fine. Consider using a sieve to achieve uniformly fine powder. Warning If powder carries moisture or is coarse, it will likely not press as easily. Packing a rod Obtain a latex balloon from the balloon drawer (under the arc melter) - check the balloon for holes or damage. For intermediate synthesis steps where the powder is to be re-ground at a later step, use the large balloons. For preparation of rods for the four-mirror optical floating zone furnace, use the medium (6 mm diameter) balloons. For preparation of rods for the laser floating zone furnaces, use the small (4 mm diameter) balloons. Clean the outside of the balloon using water and a kimwipe - try to get rid of any white powder left on the latex. Dust off the balloon using house nitrogen in the fume hood - try to get rid of remaining dust and kimwipe fibers. Warning The outside surface of the balloon will be the surface in contact with the powder. Strive to keep this surface free from contamination. Take a Q-tip and snap off the tip with the cotton swab. Take the remaining wooden stick and use some sandpaper to round down both ends. Sandpaper can be found in the small drawers to the left of the diamond saw. Dust off any remaining wood fibers or dust from the wooden stick using the house nitrogen in the fume hood. Push the wooden stick into the closed end of the balloon, turning it inside out. Slowly continue pulling the stick through the balloon. Avoid cross-contaminating the clean outer surface with the white powder that coats the inner surface of the latex. Perform small movements as to avoid the balloon bunching up on itself. Shake the balloon to take out the wooden stick. Use a Q-tip and some IPA/EtOH to clean the inner lip of the balloon. Secure a funnel on the end of the balloon. Each material typically warrants its own, clean funnel to minimize cross-contamination. Pour some powder into the funnel - shake, tap, and massage until it reaches to the bottom of the balloon. Densify the powder at the bottom of the balloon by pinching and pulling towards the end of the balloon. Gently roll flat with a ruler (or other flat surface) to try to achieve a cylindrical shape. CHECK OFTEN As you're packing and rolling, check that the shape is cylindrical, with minimal thick bulges and thin necks. It is easier to correct mistakes as soon as they happen - once you have moved further, it will be near impossible to correct a mistake that happened earlier. Packing in gradual amounts should help with this. Once the cylinder seems satisfactory, roll flat one last time using the ruler and ensure that the rod is straight. Take the balloon off the funnel and rub the \"empty\" part of the balloon between your fingers to try to knock down any remaining powder stuck to the walls. Tie one knot in the balloon close to the end of the sample (within 2 cm is fine). Gently pinch to keep air pockets out of the sealed portion. Tie a second knot above the first knot - position is less critical here. Cut the excess balloon just above the second knot - this helps avoid contaminating other processes with the excess powder stuck to the interior walls of the excess latex. Pressing the rod using the Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) If pressing a floating zone rod (medium or small balloons), obtain a plastic straw of the same diameter. Medium balloons match the blue spatula-straws, and small balloons match the regular clear soda straws. Cut the straw to the same length as the rod, and slice the straw open lengthwise into two long halves. Place the rod into the straw and wrap both ends using pieces of tape. Leave a \"tab\" to facilitate removing the tape later. Tape this contraption onto the interior wall of the metal cylinder sample holder that belongs to the CIP. Unscrew the CIP plug. Ensure there is enough antifreeze (green fluid) inside the chamber, and leave the CIP valve fully open. Lower the metal cylinder into the chamber with long forceps, and release. Before replacing the plug, check that the O-ring is intact and sandwiched between the two copper backing rings. Screw the plug all the way in, at which point the end of the threads should be aligned with the \"arrow\" symbol inscribed in the top of the chamber. Unscrew the plug a quarter turn (90 \\(^{\\circ}\\) ) to reduce wear on the threads. Fully open the house air supply on the right side of the fume hood, and flip the green \"on\" knob on the front face of the CIP. Note Turning the \"on\" knob opens a valve that allows the house air to drive the liquid pump - it will be loud when it turns on! Check the sight glass on the top face of the CIP to verify that fluid is indeed being circulated. You should see a small bubble that is \"pulsing\" with each stroke of the pump. Tighten the CIP valve, being careful not to overtighten. As soon as it is tight enough, pressure will start to build. Once it reaches the desired pressure (max. pressure 47,500 psi), flip the green power knob to the \"off\" position. At this point, pressure should hold - if it doesn't gently tighten the CIP valve. You can turn off the air supply at this point. Wait the desired amount of hold time. For most samples, you can wait as little as 30 seconds. Gently crack open the CIP valve, allowing the pressure to drop smoothly down to zero. Once it is at zero, fully open the CIP valve. Use two metal rods to unscrew the CIP plug. Use long forceps to remove the metal cylinder from inside the CIP chamber. Be careful not to avoid rough motions and bumps as to avoid breaking the newly pressed rod. Bring the metal cylinder to the sink and rinse excess antifreeze off with tap water. Replace the CIP plug - no need to screw it on all the way, as long as objects can't fall into the chamber. Remove sample from cylinder, and wash off excess antifreeze with IPA/EtOH. Extracting the rod Note For large and medium balloons, you can get away with using a razor blade to slice open the length of the balloon, without using any support. The rod should be strong enough to hold itself together without cracking at these diameters. Use scissors to cut open the balloon near the sample. Obtain the \"sandbox\" extracting tool and fill groove with sand ( locally sourced ). Ensure sand bed is flat and uniform. Lay rod down into the sand bed, and ensure that sand uniformly supports the length of the rod. Obtain a piece of tape, and use de-static tool to prepare the tape before gently taping down the rod. Completely tape down the entire length of the rod. Obtain a curved razor blade and slowly cut down the length of the sample. As you go, peel the balloon left and right to release it from the rod. Once the balloon is mostly open (2 mm - 4 mm remaining), slice the tape to release the rod from the sand bed. Slowly pull the balloon off the sample, pulling as anti-parallel as possible (like peeling a banana). Tip Once pressed, the rod will not stay pressed for very long. Do not wait longer than a few hours to begin sintering the rod. If you need to store the rod in the interim for transportation, you can wrap it in a kimwipe and place it in a long centrifuge tube. Sintering the rod Several options exist for sintering floating zone rods. Box furnaces and tube furnaces : Use an alumina boat, preferably with some powder of similar composition acting as a \"powder bed\" to prevent any reaction between the alumina and your rod. In the ESB 3312 lab, the back wall of SentroTech furnaces can operate between 1100 \\(^\\circ\\) C and 1600 \\(^\\circ\\) C. The other box furnaces can operate between room temperature and approximately 1000 \\(^\\circ\\) C.

After a ring has been used, the MoS \\(_2\\) can optionally be re-coated using one of two techniques: Pour some powdered MoS \\(_2\\) into the seal ring box and shake by hand. Uniformly spray coat the ring with MoS \\(_2\\) spray in a fume hood. Heat and chemical shield (shroud) The volatilization of material during growth cannot be completely mitigated by the application of high pressure, warranting the use of a heat and chemical shield inside the chamber to protect the chamber walls and windows from material ejected out of the molten zone. This is accomplished using a copper-beryllium (CuBe) shroud which consists of a shroud cup, lower shroud piece, cylindrical window, and upper shroud piece. Assembling the shroud and loading the sample Clean the top and bottom sealing surfaces using IPA/EtOH and a Kimwipe until the Kimwipe appears free of any residue. Use an air duster to blow off the Kimwipe fibers off the sealing surface. Gently place Destec sealing rings on the top face of the chamber and the top face of the lower translator. Shroud cup : The shroud cup sits at the very bottom of the lower inconel adapter, and is meant to prevent material entering into the neck of the pressure tube of the lower translator. It is also useful for catching bits of crystals that have fallen down after growth. The cup has a hole in the center to allow the translator shaft to pass through it, and because this hole has a relatively large diameter a stainless steel collar is usually placed around the translator shaft just on top of the shroud cup to limit powder falling into this gap. Place a collar and washer on the bottom translator shaft, about 5 mm below the notch meant to hold the seed rod. This washer is meant to catch falling debris. Mount the seed rod holder using the bottom set screw. Lower shroud : The lower shroud piece can be distinguished from the upper shroud piece because it has a sloped interior groove near the bottom end that mates with the top lip of the shroud cup. It is also slightly shorter than the upper shroud. Carefully place the lower shroud over the seed rod and down into the adapter to mate with the shroud cup. (It may be necessary to lower the seed rod in order to get the shroud over it.) There is a hole on the face of the shroud which should align with the gas outlet port on the chamber. Rotate the shroud until the hole is aligned. Cylindrical glass window : The cylindrical glass window for LOKII is simply a glass tube that has been diced to the correct height. There is no anti-reflective coating and thus the windows are relatively inexpensive. These windows get damaged over time, especially when in contact with hot volatile material. Danger There is a window specifically for LAPIS which is anti-reflection coated at 820 nm - do not use this one with LOKII! This AR-coated window has a visible coloration on the surface of the glass and is typically kept in a separate container. These are very expensive windows due to the cost of the coating (~>$1,000), so be very careful with them. Carefully slide the lower translator housing upward until the inconel adapter is flush with the bottom face of the chamber. Upper shroud : Similar to the lower shroud, except there is no sloped interior groove on the top end. This shroud piece also has a hole, which is meant to align with the inlet gas port on the chamber. Gently lower the upper shroud into the top opening of the chamber with the hole aligned, and the shroud will seat gently into the cylindrical glass window. Mount a washer and collar onto the upper translator shaft, about 5 mm above the notched region. Mount another washer and the upper half of the feed rod holder to the upper translator shaft, using the single set screw on the feed rod holder. Slide the upper translator housing down until the adapter is flush with the top face of the chamber. Be cautious to not allow the feed rod to collide with the seed rod. It helps to lower the seed rod beforehand. Check the alignment of the feed rod by rotating it in the beam. If not satisfactory, the alignment can be fixed by sliding up the upper translator housing and bending the inconel wire. Satisfactory alignment is more loosely defined for the feed rod than it is for the seed rod. Some precession is allowable, as the surface tension of the molten zone will keep the feed rod centered after joining the rods during growth. (Satisfactory alignment image) Sealing the Destec Clamps The Destec clamps are sealed using a set of four bolts and eight nuts. Ideally, the clamp slides smoothly over the inconel adapters, to optimize self-alignment of the parts. To this end, it is recommended to maintain a light coating of MoS \\( \\(_2\\) \\) powder on the interior of the clamps and on the exterior of the adapter. This can be achieved by taking a small amount of MoS \\( \\(_2\\) \\) powder between your fingers (gloved, of course), and rubbing it inside the clamp. This doesn't need to happen every time, but the coating should be re-applied if the clamps are getting stuck on the furnace after a growth is complete. The nuts and bolts should be assembled as in the following image, where the bolt is flush with the nut on one side of the clamp and protruding past the nut on the opposite side. The nuts have two distinct faces: one side is flat and dull with some text, while the other side is shiny and curved and plain. The shiny, curved side needs to be oriented to face the clamps, and the dull, flat, labeled side needs to face away from the clamp. Tip It is recommended that the \"flush\" side be on the dominant-handed side of the user, as this is the side where the torque will need to be applied. (CLAMP IMAGE) Pre-assemble the clamp as shown below: Hold the clamps up to the chamber-translator interface and use two nuts to hold the clamp up. Insert the remaining two bolts + nuts. Gently tighten the four bolts until the clamps are parallel - this is determined visually and by approximately measuring the gap between the clamps using a finger. Once the clamps are aligned, firmly tighten them by hand. Obtain the 1-1/16\" wrench and the torque wrench with 1-1/16\" socket. Set the torque 23 ft-lbs. (Image) Tighten the first bolt a quarter-turn. If the position of the bolt does not allow for the full range of motion for a quarter turn, begin by placing the torque wrench at the \"end\" of the range of motion and then move it in reverse.

The second generation has a thicker lead screw and keyed shaft. Raising and lowering the translator housings Counterweight system Each translator is quite heavy, and sliding it up and down on the furnace framing is facilitated by iron counterweights which attach the translators via a cable-pulley system. Each counterweight is equipped with a so-called \"handbrake\" which can be tightened to lock its position. Where and where not to grab Using the translator touchscreen Warning There are several important considerations when using the translators: Never allow the translators to reach their maximum translation limits. There are limit switches to automatically stop translation once these limits are reached, but they are not guaranteed to work and failure here can cause costly damage to the translator units. The translators should never translate without rotation enabled. Always MODIFY the automatic translation speed before enabling slow automatic translation - there is a software error that can lead to accidental fast translation if the speed has remained unmodified for an extended period of time. Specifically, we suspect that this occurs only after the 2-finger automatic fast gear mode (see below) has been used and the automatic translation speed has not been changed since this mode. The translators are controlled entirely via the touchscreen monitor next to the computers. Each of the buttons is used by tapping once, with the exception of the Fast Gear fast translation buttons which must be held down constantly. Sample rotation To enable rotation, simply tap the CW or CCW buttons and the shaft will begin to rotate. The default speed is 10 revolutions per minute, which can be adjusted by adding or subtracting values using the +/- buttons under the rpm readout. Warning It is recommended to avoid using the +/- 10 rpm buttons , as these can cause decoupling of the magnet pack and/or failure of the rotation motor. Note The rotation rate has been shown to work up to 45 rpm. Some translators seem to have issues rotating at certain speeds (e.g., near 15 rpm) due to friction. Sample translation Fast Manual Translation To use fast manual translation, with rotation enabled, simply long-press the Fast Gear up/down arrows and the shaft will translate as long as the button is held down. Tip 2-finger automatic fast gear mode To long-press the Fast Gear buttons without needing to keep your finger on the screen, you may use a 1-finger press on the button followed by adding a second finger nearby on the screen, followed by releasing both fingers at the same time. Be cautious to not allow the fast gear to take the translator motors to their extreme limits - keep watch of the translators in this mode and tap the button again to disable. Slow Automatic Translation To use slow automatic translation, set a translation speed in mm/hr using the +/- buttons under the speed readout. See warning at the top of this page about errors that can cause the software to accidentally ignore this speed and \"fast move\". Then, with rotation enabled, tap the Automatic up/down buttons to begin translation. Other considerations Changing pressure too quickly Changing the pressure too quickly can violently force the translator shaft in or out of the pressure tube, decoupling it from the magnet pack and potentially damaging equipment / samples. Always pressurize and depressurize slowly to avoid this. Mechanical failure points Snapped shaft The most catastrophic failure has been mechanical failure of the attachment between the shaft and the inner magnet back at its base. The shaft is weakly attached here and even gentle torquing of the shaft can cause failure over time. Friction in bearings The translators don't have any sort of lubrication. The shaft is meant to simply glide about some plain bearings made of white plastic (Teflon?). These bearings quickly become contaminated with volatilized powder from various growths, and the translator shafts will start to squeak and vibrate as a result. Cleaning this requires opening up the translators which is quite tedious and labor and time intensive - and can be costly if done incorrectly - thus, we tend to live with such vibrations until it is absolutely necessary to replace / clean the bearings.
